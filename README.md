# Containerized-EdgeComputing
Although cloud computing as a centralized system has been established successfully, it still faces problems such as high latency and congestion in the network. Edge computing moves to a decentralized system which would reduce the prob- lems faced by cloud computing. Our implementation focuses on the use of containers as a method for edge computing
